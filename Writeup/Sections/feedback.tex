After completion of the exercise routine, we presented each participant with two types of feedback. First, a holistic one, which consisted of two percentages summarizing how the participant performed relative to our expert benchmark: rate percentage alone and rate percentage after accounting for form.  Second, a granular one comprising a detailed output of our data processing, including graphs and rates for each exercise. We then asked which type of feedback the participant would find most helpful as a means of tracking progress and improvement over time, and recorded their response.
