We recruited 23 people total, three participants completed the first round of user testing in which the main objective was to perfect our data analysis models and 20 participants completed the final round of user testing from which we collected our main data set.  Of the 20 participants who completed the study, all were undergraduate students from the age of 19 to 21.  8 of the participants are female and 12 are male.  \\
Our participants were on varying levels of athleticism and at varying fitness levels, however, we did not ask participants to identify their perceived athletic and fitness level as we did not want to bias our subjective results nor did we trust that a self identification process would be an accurate depiction of actual ability and stamina.
