The purpose of our study was to develop an exercise-tracking tool capable of tracking the volume and rate of exercise moves completed during a time period, as well as the quality or form of the move, for a wide variety of exercises in order to determine which type of feedback users would find most helpful in tracking their progress over time. Our findings show that the majority of users (75\%) preferred a detailed report of their performance as opposed to a holistic one.
