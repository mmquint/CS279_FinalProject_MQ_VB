The purpose of our study was to develop an exercise-tracking tool capable of tracking repetition count as well as form for a wide variety of exercises in order to determine which type of feedback users would find most helpful in tracking their progress over time. Our findings show that the majority of users (75\%) preferred a detailed report of their performance as opposed to a holistic one.
