If successful, our work will show that currently hard to benchmark exercises can be evaluated in terms of performance with relatively inexpensive hardware.  We predict that our measurement tool could be meaningful to potential users to track minute performance improvements and, ultimately, inspire them to continue working towards their fitness goals.  Much research has already been done regarding measuring exercise performance using technology that has inspired and motivated this research project.  We believe our work addresses a hole in this field that has not been explored that we believe will spark future work in the field of exercise motivation and progress analysis through the use of inexpensive technology.\\
Additionally, the data collected from the participant data report presentation could provide valuable insight into exercise motivation, adherence, and self evaluation in terms of isolating which data report is most helpful and how this relates to the amount and detail of data preferences.  This contribution would be very relevant to the past work completed (both in research and in product creation) regarding real time and post processing exercise evaluation tools (see related works section).
